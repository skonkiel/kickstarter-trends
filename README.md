# kickstarter-trends
This report summarizes an analysis of Kickstarter campaign data (N = 4,114), for the purpose of identifying hidden trends that can signal success for projects.

## What you'll find in this repo
* An Excel workbook containing Kickstarter campaign data analyses
* A report summarizing findings (below)

## Takeaways
Based on the analyzed data (see attached Excel workbook), a few conclusions can be drawn:

1.	Projects launched in December are least successful (likely due to limited bandwidth owing to the winter holidays). Projects launched in May appear to be most successful.
2.	Successful project categories included theater (plays), music, and film/video, suggesting that Kickstarter is well-suited for raising money for creative endeavors.
3.	Projects that were featured as “staff picks” were more likely to be successful than failures—but overall far more successful projects were not “staff picks” (only around 16% of projects were featured).
4.	Projects that had lower average donations appear to raise more money overall, suggesting that setting lower donation thresholds may encourage more donations overall, making projects more likely to be successful.
5.	Projects with lower fundraising goals were more likely to be successful.

## Limitations
The dataset primarily included US and UK-based projects, making it difficult to draw conclusions on what makes projects from other countries successful. The currencies were not normalized to USD. Finally, around 7% of the projects had fundraising goals of less than $500, which may not be useful for analyzing trends in search of success for larger fundraising targets.

## Future work
Perform analyses to confirm if the trends shown in the graphs are statistically significant, which may help develop strategy even further. Graphs that illustrate fundraising period length may also help to understand if longer periods lead to more successful fundraising pitches.
